        "This dataset contains traffic data including various counts of vehicle types across different times and days. Below are samples of these columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Time`: The timestamp of the traffic count (in intervals).\n",
        "* `Date`: The day of the month the data was recorded.\n",
        "* `Day of the Week`: The day of the week for the recorded data.\n",
        "* `CarCount`: The number of cars counted during the time interval.\n",
        "* `BikeCount`: The number of bikes counted during the time interval.\n",
        "* `BusCount`: The number of buses counted during the time interval.\n",
        "* `TruckCount`: The number of trucks counted during the time interval.\n",
        "* `Total`: Total vehicles counted during the time interval.\n",
        "* `Traffic Situation`: Qualitative assessment of the traffic (e.g., normal, congested).\n",

        "## Goal\n",
        "The primary goal of this exam is to develop a predictive model capable of determining the `Traffic Situation` based on your choice of features provided in the dataset. Students are expected to apply ensemble methods to build and evaluate their models."
